      <h3 className="bg-white text-black">Climate Action</h3>
      <p>
        I have seen first-hand the devastating impacts of natural disasters,
        increasing year after year, while responding to earthquakes, hurricanes
        and floods. No matter where the disaster, it’s always the same people
        impacted over and over, those already living in precarious conditions,
        struggling long before the disaster strikes. We can’t keep reacting to
        disasters as they happen, we need to proactively put systems in place
        that protect those most impacted, while taking strong actions on
        reducing emissions and investing in renewable energy.
      </p>
      <h3 className="bg-white text-black">Affordable Housing</h3>
      <p>
        If there is one thing the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed even further,
        it’s the homelessness crisis we’re facing in Toronto. We need to put
        into action plans that have been in the works for years and promised by
        governments but not implemented. Governments are putting money into
        temporary housing, but what we really need is for that money to be
        invested into long-term, sustainable, affordable, and supportive housing
        solutions. We also need to take a step back and work with communities to
        identify what they need, and work with them on creating infrastructure
        to meet those needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a large number of folks across the city of Toronto who are
        underhoused and being pushed out of their own communities. We need to do
        a better job of protecting these community members by closing loopholes
        around evictions and making it harder to raise rents.
      </p>
      <h3 className="bg-white text-black">Equitable Access to Healthcare</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve worked in field hospitals sent to support folks affected by
        disasters in last mile contexts, where I’ve seen inequitable access to
        healthcare magnified. I believe in a healthcare system that prioritizes
        mental health along with physical health, and where eyes and teeth are
        taken care of just like the rest of the body. This also means having
        equitable access to gender affirming surgeries across Canada, which I
        have been able to receive, but where many barriers to access still
        remain. We must remove those barriers and acknowledge the systemic
        racism and transphobia that exists in healthcare, and work to do more to
        ensure everyone has access to the healthcare and medications they need,
        at no cost.

      <h3 className="bg-white text-black">Welcoming Refugees</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked in refugee camps and spoken to folks who’ve travelled for
        years, sometimes with young children, escaping horrific situations in
        their home countries. We need to make sure Canada welcomes more
        refugees, and we need to work to remove the barriers and bureaucracy
        around this process. Once they’re in our community, we need to do more
        to support their integration, and ensure they have access to all the
        services they need.
      </p>
      <h3 className="bg-white text-black">Indigenous Rights</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in Saint Mary’s Bay, in Nova Scotia, where recently
        Mi&apos;kmaw fishers have been exercising their right to fish for a
        moderate livelihood. I stand firmly with the Mi&apos;kmaw and all other
        Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island asserting their rights to land
        and resources.
      </p>
      <h3 className="bg-white text-black">2SLGBTQIA+ Rights</h3>
      <p>
        As queer and non-binary, I work to support 2SLGBTQIA+ rights in my
        community and as part of the Ontario NDP LGBTQ Committee. We need to do
        more, especially to affirm the rights and protection of trans people of
        colour, both in Canada and abroad. I also believe that Canada can and
        should play a greater role championing 2SLGBTQIA+ rights on the world
        stage.
